    "A life-sized dinosaur head carved from a single piece of marble has been unveiled in central London.",
    "Carrara Triceratops Skull is described as an \"artistic interpretation\" of a 68-million-year-old sub-adult Triceratops skull, and measures 10ft (3m) high, 7.2ft (2.2m) long, and 5ft (1.5m) wide.",
    "The skull rests at a 20-degree angle on a grey-veined plinth in Berkeley Square.",
    "Sculptor Paul Vanstone said: \"The idea that these creatures walked this planet, charging at this angle, you get a strong sense of their presence on this planet. I wanted to portray their great scale and power.\"",
    "The prehistoric herbivores roamed the plains of what is now North America about 68-66 million years ago.",
    "Its flaring bony frill, pointed beak and three-horned head make the Triceratops one of the more recognisable dinosaurs. ",
    "The species goes through four growth stages - baby, juvenile, sub-adult and adult - and reached full maturity aged about 10.",
    "During the sub-adult growth period the Triceratops horns reorient to point towards the front of the skull and the scalloped detail of the frill becomes more defined.",
    "The sculpture will remain on display for two years and is the second public artwork displayed by David Aaron, replacing the bronze juvenile Tyrannosaurus Rex that previously occupied the site.",
    "The work can be seen at 29 Berkeley Square, located on the corner.",
